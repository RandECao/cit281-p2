# Project 2

Through this project, I acquired additional proficiency in utilizing the CLI and establishing a git repository (repo).
Furthermore, I honed my skills in refactoring JavaScript code using Visual Studio Code, gaining valuable hands-on 
experience in optimizing code structure and improving code readability.

### Skills Used in Project
- Successfully created a subfolder named "refactor" within my CIT281 class folder.
- Populated the newly created subfolder with relevant files and committed the changes to git.
- Implemented various functions in JavaScript, showcasing my proficiency in coding and problem-solving within the language.
-
      - getRandomLetter()
      - getRandomString(minLength, maxLength)
      - getRandomInteger() 
      - getSortedString(string)


- Demonstrated the ability to create function expressions and effectively utilize anonymous functions in JavaScript.
- Employed the use of a .gitignore file to exclude specific files from being tracked and displayed in the git repository.
